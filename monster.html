                <h2>Nuka-Cola</h2>
                <p>Nuka-Cola is the iconic soft drink in Fallout 4, 
                  highly sought after in the post-apocalyptic world. 
                  It comes in various variants such as Nuka-Cola Quantum 
                  or Nuka-Cherry, each with special effects. The advertising
                   and design of Nuka-Cola evoke nostalgia from the 1950s.
